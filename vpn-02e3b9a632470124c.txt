! To configure this VPN connection using the New Connection Security Rule Wizard
! in the Windows Server 2012 R2 console, use the information below and refer to
! the AWS VPC Network Administrator Guide for more information:
! http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonVPC/latest/NetworkAdminGuide/customer-gateway-windows-2012.html

! Your VPN Connection ID 		    : vpn-02e3b9a632470124c
! Your Virtual Private Gateway ID           : vgw-05dc3c872a1305fb7
! Your Customer Gateway ID		    : cgw-03af6614ae145488d

! Information needed for the configuration of your VPN connection:

! vgw-05dc3c872a1305fb7 Tunnel1
! --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
! Local Tunnel Endpoint:         54.225.36.174
! Remote Tunnel Endpoint:        34.197.9.11
! Endpoint 1:                    [Your_Static_Route_IP_Prefix]
! Endpoint 2:                    [Your_VPC_CIDR_Block]
! Preshared key:                 g6U8CoqtCo.A.IQqMUNMqeYPqlWbx8k7

! vgw-05dc3c872a1305fb7 Tunnel2
! --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
! Local Tunnel Endpoint:         54.225.36.174
! Remote Tunnel Endpoint:        54.235.62.184
! Endpoint 1:                    [Your_Static_Route_IP_Prefix]
! Endpoint 2:                    [Your_VPC_CIDR_Block]
! Preshared key:                 tKHW1bLDq7k1FGdP12iOjjmBHVdWvnGD

! Local Tunnel Endpoint:
! The IP address you entered for your customer gateway when you created
! the VPN connection for your Amazon VPC.
!
! * You should use the private IP address of the Windows Server 2012 R2 
! server rather than this IP address when you enter the Local Tunnel Endpoint
! in the New Connection Security Rule Wizard or in the netsh script below.

! Remote Tunnel Endpoint
! One of two IP addresses for the Amazon virtual private gateway that 
! terminates the VPN connection on the AWS side of the connection.

! Endpoint 1
! The IP prefix that you entered as a static route when you created your
! VPN connection. This indicates the IP addresses in your network that are 
! allowed to use the VPN connection to access your Amazon VPC.

! Endpoint 2
! The IP address range (CIDR block) of your Amazon VPC; for example, 10.0.0.0/16

! Preshared key
! This is the pre-shared key that is used to establish IPsec VPN connection
! between the Local Tunnel Endpoint and the Remote Tunnel Endpoint.

! Note
! From time to time, AWS will perform routine maintenance on the virtual private 
! gateway. This maintenance may disable one of the two tunnels of your VPN 
! connection for a brief period of time. Your VPN connection will automatically
! fail over to the second tunnel while this maintenance is performed. To ensure 
! uninterrupted service, it's important that you configure both tunnels.

! Configuration Details for IKE and IPsec
! =======================================
! Additional information regarding the Internet Key Exchange (IKE) and IPsec 
! Security Associations (SA) are presented below. Because the AWS VPC VPN
! suggested settings are the same as the Windows Server 2012 R2 default IPsec
! configuration settings, minimal work is needed on your part (see QuickModePFS
! below.)

! MainModeSecMethods:        DHGroup2-AES128-SHA1
! MainModeKeyLifetime:       480min,0sess
! QuickModeSecMethods:       ESP:SHA1-AES128+60min+100000kb
! QuickModePFS:              DHGroup2

! MainModeSecMethods
! This specifies the encryption and authentication algorithms for the IKE SA.
! These are the suggested settings for the AWS VPC VPN connection and are the
! default settings for Windows Server 2012 R2 IPsec VPN connections.

! MainModeKeyLifetime
! This specifies the IKE SA key lifetime.  This is the suggested setting for
! the AWS VPC VPN connection and is the default setting for Windows Server 
! 2012 R2 IPsec VPN connections.

! QuickModeSecMethods
! This specifies the encryption and authentication algorithms for the IPsec SA.
! These are the suggested settings for the AWS VPC VPN connection and are the
! default settings for Windows Server 2012 R2 IPsec VPN connections.

! QuickModePFS
! The use of master key perfect forward secrecy (PFS) is suggested for your
! IPsec sessions. Enabling PFS isn't possible via the Windows Server 2012 R2
! user interface. The only way to enable this setting is to execute the netsh
! script (below) with QMPFS=dhgroup2

! Dead Gateway Detection
! --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
! To configure TCP to detect when a gateway becomes unavailable, run the following
! command to enable Dead Gateway Detection:
reg add HKLM\System\CurrentControlSet\services\Tcpip\Parameters ^
/v EnableDeadGWDetect /t REG_DWORD /d 1

! After you change the registry key, you must reboot the server. 

! Netsh script to configure your IPsec VPN connection
! --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
! You can automatically configure your IPsec VPN connection by copying and pasting
! the netsh scripts below. Replace the items in brackets [] with the appropriate
! values as indicated above.

! Script for Tunnel 1:
netsh advfirewall consec add rule Name="vgw-05dc3c872a1305fb7 Tunnel 1" `
Enable=Yes Profile=any Type=Static Mode=Tunnel `
LocalTunnelEndpoint=192.168.0.23 `
RemoteTunnelEndpoint=34.197.9.11 Endpoint1="192.168.0.0/16" `
Endpoint2="10.10.0.0/16" Protocol=Any Action=RequireInClearOut `
Auth1=ComputerPSK Auth1PSK=g6U8CoqtCo.A.IQqMUNMqeYPqlWbx8k7 `
QMSecMethods=ESP:SHA1-AES128+60min+100000kb `
ExemptIPsecProtectedConnections=No ApplyAuthz=No QMPFS=dhgroup2

! Script for Tunnel 2:
netsh advfirewall consec add rule Name="vgw-05dc3c872a1305fb7 Tunnel 2" `
Enable=Yes Profile=any Type=Static Mode=Tunnel `
LocalTunnelEndpoint=192.168.0.23 `
